# Algorithms Lab 2020

## Overview

This repository consists of my solutions for course Algorithms Lab at ETH Zurich, which I attended during Autumn Semester 2020.

The solutions for the problems needed to be correct, fast and created in a limited amount of time. Therefore, the coding style for these solutions is not always perfect.

My solutions were tested using automated online judge and they achieved maximal number of points.
